# BioDP-SyNet: Biophysically Orchestrated Dual-Path Synergistic Network for Breast Tumour Segmentation

<!-- [](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx) [](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) -->

**BioDP-SyNet** is a novel, physics-informed deep learning framework designed for precise and robust breast tumour segmentation in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). By integrating MRI governing equations and biophysical principles, BioDP-SyNet effectively addresses challenges such as intratumoral heterogeneity, imaging noise, and artefactual interference.

## Abstract

Highly sensitive to tissue haemodynamics, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) increasingly functions as the modality of choice for early breast-cancer screening and diagnosis, yet intratumoral heterogeneity, imaging noise and artefactual interferenceâ€”coupled with CNNsâ€™ constrained receptive fields that impede global-structure captureâ€”erect formidable barriers to automated, precise tumour segmentation. Addressing these challenges, this work presents the **Biophysically Orchestrated Dual-Path Synergistic Network (BioDP-SyNet)**, wherein MRI-physical governing equations and physics-informed neural paradigms converge within parallel spatial-diffusion and frequency-fluctuation pathways.

  - The **spatial stream** embeds an **Edge-Preserving Explicit Diffusion (EPED) layer** for adaptive, iterative smoothing, abating signal variance and noise.
  - The **frequency stream** integrates **FreqDualis-HoloSchrod (FDH) Attention** and **Laplacian-Gradient (La-Gra) Attention** to emulate frequency interference and phase modulation, heightening sensitivity to textural nuance and local-frequency anomalies.

Evaluation on BreastDM and BCMedSet demonstrates BioDP-SyNet's gains in Dice, IoU and 95HD, with pronounced small-lesion detection and complex-boundary delineation.

## Core Architecture

BioDP-SyNet employs a dual-encoder, single-decoder architecture with parallel paths that synergistically extract and enhance features from two complementary physical perspectives.BioDP-SyNet employs a dual-encoder, single-decoder architecture with parallel paths that synergistically extract and enhance features from two complementary physical perspectives.

### 1\. Spatial Diffusion Path

This path focuses on suppressing image noise and smoothing the highly heterogeneous signals within tumour regions.

![Edge-Preserving Explicit Diffusion Layer](https://github.com/IMOP-lab/BioDP-SyNet/raw/main/Picture/EPED.png)

  - **EPED (Edge-Preserving Explicit Diffusion) Layer**: The core module, which abstracts feature maps as manifolds and evolves them using an adaptive Partial Differential Equation (PDE). It effectively removes high-frequency noise while preserving critical tumour boundary structures via a content-aware diffusion coefficient.

### 2\. Frequency Fluctuation Path

This path is designed to overcome the local receptive field limitations of traditional convolutions, capturing macroscopic tumour morphology and fine boundary geometry.

  - **FDH (FreqDualis-HoloSchrod) Attention**: Inspired by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation from quantum mechanics, this module operates in the frequency domain to capture global shape information and phase consistency, crucial for holistic morphological assessment.

![Laplacian-Gradient Attention](https://github.com/IMOP-lab/BioDP-SyNet/raw/main/Picture/La-Gra.png)

  - **La-Gra (Laplacian-Gradient) Attention**: Embeds fixed differential operators (Laplacian and gradient) as explicit physical priors into the attention mechanism. This enables the model to better distinguish true anatomical boundaries from artifacts and enhances its sensitivity to subtle boundary details.
